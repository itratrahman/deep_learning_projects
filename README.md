# Deep Learning Projects

## Repository Description
This repository contains my deep learning projects. These project cover various domains of AI; ranging from computer vision, to natural language processing, and to time series analysis. The jupyter notebooks here serve as excellent tutorials.

## Installation of Drivers & Software
Most models are trained using `gpu enabled virtual machines` on Google Cloud with the latest versions of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and `cuda drivers`installed. So do not try to run them without gpu-enabled workstations or linux kernels. I am currently using deep learning virtual machines which can be deployed with 1 click.
